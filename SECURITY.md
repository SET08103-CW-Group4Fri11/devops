# Reporting Security Issues

The A team and community take security bugs in A seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/SET08103-CW-Group4Fri11/devops/security) tab.

The A team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within 6 business days, or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may escalate to the OpenJS Foundation CNA at `security@lists.openjsf.org`.

If the project acknowledges your report but does not provide any further response or engagement within 14 days, escalation is also appropriate.
