' ---------------- Countries reports ----------------

' Example inputs: scope = World/Continent/Region, order = DESC
note right of UC_COUNTRIES
Scope examples:
• World
• By Continent
• By Region
Output:
• Code, Name, Continent,
Region, Population, Capital

' ---------------- Cities reports ----------------
package "Cities" as Cities {

note right of UC_CITIES
Scope examples:
• World / Continent / Region / Country / District
Output:
• City Name, Country, District,
Population
end note

package "Capital Cities" as Capitals {
usecase "Capital Cities by\nPopulation" as UC_CAPITALS
usecase "Top N Capital Cities\n(Global/Continent/Region)" as UC_TOPN_CAPITALS

Scope examples:

Output:

Parameters:
• N (positive integer)
• Optional: Continent / Region
Behavior:
• Sorted by Population DESC
