| Scope:                     | [the system or subsystem under consideration]               | 
| Level:                     | [Summary, Primary task, subfunction]                        |
| Initiating Actor:          | [actor initiating interaction with the system]              |
| Preconditions:             | [assumed state of the system before the interaction]        |
| Successful End Conditions: | [result after the goal is achieved]                         |
| Failed End Conditions:     | [result if the goal is not achieved]                        |

Flow of Events for Main Success Scenario:

| # | Direction | Actor Action &harr; System Response |
|---|:---------:|-------------------------------------|
| 1 |  &rarr;   | [initiating action]                 |
| 2 |  &larr;   | [system reaction/response]          |
| 3 |  &rarr;   | [...]                               |

Flow of Events for Extensions (Alternate Scenarios):

| #  | Direction | Actor Action &harr; System Response |
|----|:---------:|-------------------------------------|
| a1 |  &rarr;   | [initiating action]                 |
| a2 |  &larr;   | [system reaction/response]          |
| a3 |  &rarr;   | [...]                               |

(The arrows on the left indicate whether the action is initiated by the actor (&rarr;) or the system (&larr;).)
